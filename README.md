# Sample Kotlin bot targeting the JVM

This is an example of how you would start writing a bot with Kotlin and/or Java code. This uses gradle as the main build
tool. I recommend using IntelliJ IDEA as your main IDE, as it has very good support for Kotlin (JetBrains developed 
Kotlin). However, this should all work from the command line too.

The implementation here is simply the tutorial bot given in https://ocraft.github.io/ocraft-s2client. You are free to
write your bot however you like, this hopefully just helps you get started with building and organising your code.
